# COSC 61 Final Project - Movie Analysis Database Build Plan
Below are the details of how we imported and prepared our data as well as how we built our database.

## Pre Importation
Before importing the data to MySQL workbench, we filtered out fields from the original dataset that we did not plan on using in our database for the sake of simplicity. We also decomposed the data into two files, `data_1` and `data_2`. `data_1` contained the general attributes while `data_2` contained only the fields in json format, allowing for more careful inspection and decomposition of the json text.

## Import Method

## Import Code
## General Cleaning

The general syntax for how we loaded our data is as follows:
```
SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'pathname/data_file.csv'
INTO TABLE table_to_load_data_into
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES;
```


Include:
Description of the import method
Import code if relevant
Explanation of how you prepared your data- such as:
Did you update the data in csv or other format before import?
Did you decompose data after import?
What, if any, data changes did you have to make to address any issues?



Below are the details of how we plan to implement our databse design in accordance with our preliminary ERD.

## Main Data

Our plan to import the data is to import the main CSV found on our project site to Workbench using the Import Wizard. 

## General Table Construction

Using the ERD feature on MySQLWorkbench we have already generated the following tables:


`movies`, `outcomes`, `directors`, `movie_keyword`, `keywords`, `movie_genre`, `genres`, `movie_company`, `companies`, `movie_country`, `countries`, `languages`

## Specific Table Construction

Then, each of the tables will be constructed using the `ALTER TABLE` command to add each of the attributes. Then we will use the `INSERT INTO` command to insert values into the tables from the main movies table. Certain of the tables will require extra parsing/data cleaning to create, like the countries and companies tables. 

### `movies` table

* `movie_id` is an existing variable in the table that we will grab from the original CSV.
* `title` is an existing variable in the table that we will grab from the original CSV.
* `overview` is an existing variable in the table that we will grab from the original CSV.
* `director_id` is a foreign key which references the `directors` table.
* `language_id` is a foreign key which references the `languages` table.
* `runtime` is an existing variable in the table that we will grab from the original CSV.
* `release_date` is an existing variable in the table that we will grab from the original CSV.

### `outcomes` table

* `movie_id` is a foreign key which references the ‘movies’ table.
* `budget` is an existing variable in the table that we will grab from the original CSV.
* `revenue` is an existing variable in the table that we will grab from the original CSV.
* `popularity` is an existing variable in the table that we will grab from the original CSV.
* `vote_average` is an existing variable in the table that we will grab from the original CSV.
* `vote_count` is an existing variable in the table that we will grab from the original CSV.

### `directors` table

* `director_id` is generated with auto increment. Each director will automatically be assigned an id.
* `director` is a variable from the existing table that we will grab from the original CSV. We will use the `DISTINCT` keyword to avoid duplicate records for directors who may have been involved in more than one movie in the database.

### `movie_keyword` table

* `movie_id`  is a foreign key which references the `movies` table.
* `keyword_id` is a foreign key which references the `keywords` table.

### `keywords` table

* `keyword_id` is generated with auto increment. Each keyword will automatically be assigned an id.
* `keyword` is an attribute present in the original data. In the original data, keywords are listed one after another, separated by spaces. We plan to split the text by spaces to generate a list of keywords, and then put `DISTINCT` keywords into this table.

### `movie_genre` table

* `movie_id`  is a foreign key which references the `movies` table.
* `genre_id` is a foreign key which references the `genres` table.

### `genres` table

* `genre_id` is generated with auto increment. Each genre will automatically be assigned an id.
* `genre` is an attribute present in the original data. In the original data, genres are listed one after another, separated by spaces. We plan to split the text by spaces to generate a list of genres, and then place each `DISTINCT` genre in this table

#### NOTE:
The two fields `production_companies` and `production_countries` from the original movies table contain JSON text, which we will need to parse to create the `movie_company`, `companies`, `movie_country`, and `countries` tables. These fields contain ids for the `companies` and `countries`, as well as their names.

### `movie_company` table

* `movie_id` is a foreign key which references the `movies` table.
* `company_id` is a foreign key which references the `companies` table.


### `companies` table

* `company_id` is a foreign key which references the `companies` table. It will be grabbed from the `production_company` field in the original CSV.
* `company` is the name of the company, grabbed from the `production_company` field in the original CSV.


### `movie_country` table

* `movie_id` is a foreign key which references the `movies` table.
* `country_id` is a foreign key which references the `countries` table.

### `countries` table

* `country_id` is the primary key grabbed from the `production_company` field in the original CSV.
* `country` is the name of the country and is also grabbed from `production_company` field in the original CSV.

### `languages` table

* `language_id` is created through auto-increment when languages are inserted.
* `language` is the name of the language.
