### Overview
This project involves the creation of a MySQL database from a large dataset found online [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/movies-dataset). We formed some initial questions we wanted the database to answer, created a structure that could efficiently store our movies data, and implemented this structure using the initial data. Ultimately we have used the database to create a web game that incorporates several metrics about the movies and has the user guess which movie has a higher or lower metric.

## Link to [Milestone 1](milestone_1/) - Initial Dataset and Questions
This milestone contains the following elements:
- description of the original dataset
- four questions we set out to answer after building the database

## Link to [Milestone 2](milestone_2/) - Database Build Plan
This milestone contains the following elements:
- our plan for building the database, including:
  - our proposed entity-relationship diagram (ERD) for the database
  - explanations of each table and where their data fields would be coming from
  - a brief overview of how we were planning to construct these tables using the original dataset csv we were provided with

## Link to [Milestone 3](milestone_3/) - Database Implementation Details
This milestone contains the following elements:
- a thorough explanation with code samples on how we implemented our plan to create the tables layed out in our schema in milestone 2
- a brief answer to one of our original questions to prove database functionality
## Link to [Milestone 4](milestone_4/) - Database Enhancements & Answering Questions
This milestone contains the following elements:
- a thorough explanation of our database enhancement fullstack web game and how it grabs from our database
- more thorough answers to all four of our original questions and what we learned from them
